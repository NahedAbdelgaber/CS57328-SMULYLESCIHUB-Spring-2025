#### What we want to add/change about the system:

For adding new features, we brainstormed this user story idea.

User Story: As a contractor, I want to be able to filter posts to see certain tech ideas to work on

Conditions of satisfaction:

Filter by tech type (from preset categories).  
Filter by date posted (from x date to x date) (calendar drop down)
Filter by budget range (min and max slider in react)

When we make a new post we will have to have fields 1 - 3

1-3 should each be a drop down with visible choices that are in the database
